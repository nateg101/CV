## Nat Elliott-Green

I am a fullstack developer, a graduate from a top UK university and am currently studying at one of the most selective dev bootcamps. All this is backed by a 6 year career working as an energy analyst and supporting database development projects. I have a left a comfortable, varied and successful career to pursue the 'difficult' option, namely a career in software development. I have made this move because the tech industry is fast-paced, challenging and gives me the opportunity to solve problems on a daily basis.

#### This Skill
