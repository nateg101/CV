I am a fullstack developer, a graduate from a top UK university and am currently studying at one of the most selective dev bootcamps. This is backed by a 6 year career working as an energy analyst and supporting database development projects. I have a left a comfortable, varied and successful career to pursue the 'difficult' option, namely a career as a developer. I have made this move because the tech industry is fast-paced, challenging and gives me the opportunity to solve problems on a daily basis, all of which I really love.

## Skills

### Key Coding Skills

* Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Sinatra.
* JavaScript, React, jQuery, Jasmine, Cypress.
* Travis CI, Heroku, Git, Html, CSS.
* Agile and XP values.
* Consistent TDD and debugging processes.

### Process Redesign and Optimisation

- I have always had an interest in taking processes, pulling them apart to make them as efficient and sensible as possible for users.
- At ActionAid I redesigned business processes for the global child sponsorship scheme, which accounted for over 1/3 of income. The processes were inefficient, inflexible and incomplete which held back the organisation. Changing these processes has allowed the organisation to exploit digital technologies, reduce administrative work and improve testing of the child sponsorship fundraising product. 

### Continuous Development

- Working in tech is brilliant and each day I push myself to be better than the previous one. Gaining new skills means that I am able to achieve things that previously would never have crossed my mind. However, the more I learn the more I realise I don't know, I am continually reassessing where my skill-base and checking in with my peers in the industry to seee how I can fine tune my skills and incorporate this into my work.

#### Communication and Teaching

- I enjoy communicating complex or challenging problems, and am able to break them down or use analogies to help people learn, including myself.
- I have supported a number of colleagues in their professional development, aiding many of them to become key subject matter experts.
- When at Clarksons Research I line managed a new hire, this involved teaching and explaining writing style, the mechanics of the various models and the intricacies of global energy trade. In order to explain global energy trade trends I broke down the various factors that go in to driving supply and demand and using relatable metaphors like making someone dinner. The result of this work meant that within a year this person was managing the team I had recently left.
